            <p>
                What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking" target="_blank">software
                defined networking</a> you may ask? Software defined networks are an architecture that
                provides a different dynamic; It’s manageable, cost-effective, as well as adaptable. All of these make
                software defined networks complete for having a high bandwidth. The software defined networking
                architecture dissociates the network control as well as the forwarding functions, which then allows the
                network control to enhance into being programmable. Moreover, the underlying infrastructure is
                abstracted to add applications and network services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The image to the left shows how the architecture is designed to look. Firstly, we start with the
                application layer, move down to the control layer and lastly, the infrastructure layer. The application
                layer contains business applications. The control layer contains the network services. In order to
                transfer data into the infrastructure, the protocol
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFlow" target="_blank">OpenFlow</a> is used.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout this webpage, you will be reading through, one: how software defined
                networking is structured, two: how SDN started, three: how SDN works, fourth: why SDN was created,
                fifth: pros and cons, sixth: the importance of SDN, seventh: protocols of SDN, and lastly, how
                to create a software defined network.

            <h2>Brief History of Software Defined Networking</h2>
            <img src="media\Picture3.jpeg" alt="Martin Casado" class="images" id="image-c">
            <p>
                Now when you hear of SDN you may think, “Huh, I know what software defined networking is but when did it
                all start?”. Of course, anyone would be curious to know when and where SDN first started to get a bit of
                background about it. At Stanford in 2005, a man named Martin Casado’s thesis work got super hyped, and
                that’s where all the talk of software defined networking came into play. A little background on who
                Martin Casado is; He is a software engineer, who is currently 45 years old. Let’s get to know more about
                what Martin Casado did with software defined networks. In 2007, Casado worked with some of his friends
                from Stanford to form <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nicira" target="_blank">Nicira Networks</a>.
                In 2012, Nicira Networks was obtained by
                <a href="https://www.vmware.com/latam/company/acquisitions/nicira.html" target="_blank">VMWare</a>.
                Afer this, Casado and his friends developed the first standard interface called OpenFlow. This interface
                helped to separate the network control as well as the data planes. Later in 2014,
                <a href="https://opennetworking.org/onos/" target="_blank">Open Network Operating System</a> (ONOS) was
                developed which is an open-source software defined network controller that the operators have access to.
                Then, in 2017, CORD used the ‘Edge Cloud’ solution that had about 70 percent of the operators planned to
                move CORD and transfer the networks. Overall, software defined networking has been around since 2007 and
                has been evolving ever since then.

            <h2>How Does Software Defined Networking Work?</h2>
            <img src="media\Picture2.png" alt="SDN Process" class="images" id="image-b">
            <p>
                Now that we know a little about SDN’s background, let’s move on to talk about how SDN works. As
                mentioned earlier the three steps of software defined networking are applications, controllers, and
                networking devices. We are now going to talk about them in more detail. Firstly, within applications,
                it is possible to communicate resource requests as well as information that is related to the network
                overall. Secondly, controllers use information from the applications that were sent previously. The
                controllers use the information from the applications so that the route of a data packet can be decided.
                Moreover, networking devices will receive the information from the applications and controller about
                where this data and information needs to be moved. The information and data are moved through the
                network, however, sometimes within the software or hardware, a virtual switch can be embedded. When the
                virtual switch is embedded into the hardware or software, it would take the responsibility from the
                physical switch and then merge the functions into a single as well as intelligent switch. When this
                process happens, the switch will check to see if the morals of the data packets along with the virtual
                machine target, then will move all the packets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The picture to the right shows exactly what was mentioned in the previous paragraph. This is a visual
                representation of how software defined networks work. This image shows the process of software defined
                networking, going from application, control, and infrastructure. The example given in this image is a
                representation of business applications. It shows how software defined networking works within the
                business field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, software defined networks were created to establish a connection within a network so that
                people within industries or businesses could use software defined networks. The number one priority is a
                good connection. With a good connection, someone can connect to others on the web so that software
                defined networks could be used in promoting sales and deals. It could also be used for customer service
                purposes, internal communication, and document sharing. For example, when a teacher sends a lab document
                to his/her students, it is shared with multiple students. Similarly, when students share documents
                with each other using <a href="https://docs.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> or
                <a href="https://www.office.com/launch/word?auth=2" target="_blank">Microsoft Word</a>, this is a
                software defined network being used as a way to help them and make work more efficient. The creation
                of software defined networks also allows a new way of being able to control the routing of data packets
                through a centralized server. Without the creation of software defined networks, a lot of today’s
                applications would not work or exist. Some examples are cloud networks, programs for network
                virtualization, network monitoring, intrusion detection, and flow balancing. A huge benefit of software
                defined networking is the ability to easily move data between distributed locations which is necessary
                for cloud applications. This is how software defined networking moves a ton of data from documents we
                create so efficiently. Another benefit would be network administrators being able to also add or remove
                virtual machines from any network through SDN, regardless of whether those machines are on-premises or
                in the cloud.

            <p>
                Although software defined networking has a ton of advantages to it, there are also major flaws as well.
                One flaw is the security of SDN because of how easy it is to breach it. People can create configuration
                errors within the network because of how easy the programming languages are within the SDN logic. This
                makes the applications within the network more vulnerable to being attacked by other people and hacked
                into. In order to implement the software defined network's protocols and controllers, the whole
                network infrastructure must be changed. As a result, the network must be reconfigured from the ground up.
                This also increases costs for maintaining the network.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes software defined networking so important is that in comparison with traditional networking,
                SDN represents a substantial leap forward and enables an increase in speed, control, and flexibility. A
                software-based controller can automate the flow of traffic over a network without needing to program
                multiple vendor-specific hardware devices. The flexibility of selecting networking equipment is also
                enhanced because administrators can choose a single protocol to communicate with multiple types of
                hardware through a single controller.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important ability of software defined networking is customizing the network infrastructure. A
                software defined network lets administrators adjust the network infrastructure in real-time by
                configuring network services and distributing virtual resources from a central location. OpenFlow and
                the <a href="https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/ref/ovsdb.7/" target="_blank">Open Virtual Switch
                Database</a> (OVSDB) are the most widely used protocols by software defined network controllers to
                communicate with switches/routers. As well as these protocols, many other open-standard and
                collaborative protocols are currently being developed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, software defined networking is the main source of our everyday use of technology as we
                use networking every day. Hoping for our network performance to work well, we use SDN to ensure that we
                are getting the most efficient network configuration. It helps us with efficiency in connecting to the
                network and easily connecting to servers. Although we have problems, such as weak security, software
                defined networking still has more benefits in our lives than negatives. Software defined networks have
                created most applications and without it we would not have many of them such as cloud networks, programs
                for network virtualization, network monitoring, intrusion detection, flow balancing, and more. This is
                why software defined networking is so important in today's world, and for the future.
